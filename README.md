# saasrobotics.github.io

This is the repository for saasrobotics.github.io, aka saasrobotics.com.

It it somewhat strange in that the results of the build are kept in the same branch of the source (as opposed to e.g. `gh-pages`). For this reason, in order to maintain consistency, you **must** run `gulp build` before you commit. Otherwise your changes will not go live on saasrobotics.com.
